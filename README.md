# 2018-Summer-Project-Pokemon-Showdown-and-Guess-the-Flag-Game
Created in 2018 for APCSA final project in collaboration with Brandon Wang and Aman Singh. The Pokemon game was coded by me. This was coded and works on Code.org. (https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/JZ3OjjWSnAojbGvDycVW3f3LJ80PzZqSeOn8Xe2IcUA) However, images seem to no longer be compatible.
